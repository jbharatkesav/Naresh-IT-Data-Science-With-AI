Error type

compile time error
logical error
runtime error

rules to define python:

1. variable does not start with number but can end with number 
2. variable case sensitive ( if you mention in lowercase & call the value in lower case only.
3.special characters are not allowed in variable
4. only _ is allowed
5. keyword cannot be a variable 
keywords are 35

6. Variable = identifier = object

syntax of variable:
variable = value

v= 5 (int)
v1 5.5( float value)
v2 = 'nit'(String)
v3 = True (bool)
v4 = 1 + 2j (complex)
datatype is born from variable

Python Data type vs
Python functions always ends with ():
complex data type only found in python programming
 c= a + bj
c = variable
a = real part
b = imaginary part
j = square root of -1
parameter = argument 

String (20-06-2025)
id is memory address
''' ''' - multi line comments
' ' - single line
Indexing
forward index begins with 0 (left to right)
backward index begins with -1 (right - left)

python introduction:
python interpreter---if you execute the code line by line
python compiler-- entire code is runs at a time
---python is object oriented programming language
---a = 5
'a' is called variable or also called as object


"( class
method
object
encapsulation
polymorphism
abstraction)

python is dynamic programming language
a = 5 int data type
a = 5.5 float


python datastructure:

 ---inbuild ds
 ---we can assign more than one value in data structure
---in datatype we can assign only one value
---DS Is collection of data types
---data type = int, float, complex, bool , string
---

premitive = float, integer, string, boolian
Non- premitive - 2 types
1. built in - list, tuple, dictionary, set
2. user defind - stack, queue, linkedlist, tree
